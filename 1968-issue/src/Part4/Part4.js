        I wasn’t part of Students for a Democratic Society. I was part of the literary scene—in the Columbia Review, excited by the poetry of Kenneth Koch and the readings and parties revolving around the newly established St. Mark’s Poetry Project in the East Village. I had gone to one SDS meeting and, although I agreed with their views against the war and the gym, I was repelled by the factions arguing with each other. 
        </p>
        <p>    
        I didn’t think the initial occupation of Hamilton Hall would achieve anything, so, the first night, I went back to my apartment. I wasn’t too confident that SDS and Student Afro-American Society could pull off a major protest.
        </p>
        <p> 
        The first hours of the Hamilton occupation were chaotic. This was a mass movement (although I didn’t use the term at the time), and that meant that white students with all levels of commitment and discipline (or lack of discipline) were there: some to party, some to debate, and some to hunker down until the cops arrived. The black students, much fewer in number, were more disciplined and cohesive; they were the core of the rebellion. When I returned early the next morning, I discovered that the black students had asked the white students to leave and take their own building. 
        </p>
        <p>
        By the time I got to that building, the president’s office in Low Library had already been occupied, and I got in through an open window by climbing along the wide ledge. Occupying the president’s office was bold, outrageous, and it seemed that the protest had reached a new, more serious level. Except for leaving to get a change of clothes, I spent the entire time of the occupation in University President Grayson Kirk’s office—until the police broke through the barricaded doors to beat everyone viciously, despite the nonviolent nature of our resistance.
        </p>
        <p>
        I attended a coed high school in Queens, with the school body roughly half-white and half-black. At Columbia, there were few or no women in our classes and only a handful of black students, and all the social dynamics seemed strange. I had many African-American friends at Andrew Jackson High School—we worked together in the civil rights movement, edited the literary magazine, and acted together in our drama club. That’s not to say it was an island free of the racism that infected the rest of America, but there wasn’t such a stark separation. Columbia, however, seemed to be very much behind, and I hardly had contact with any of the few black students. The gym being built in a public park was a clear racist affront: The idea of a front door for mostly white students and a back door downhill for the Harlem community reeked of segregation, and we called it Gym Crow. But, back then, I had no idea of the great degree of personal racism that the black students faced on campus; I only learned of that many years later.
        </p>
        <p>
        The Nazis murdered almost all of my family in Poland, except for my parents, who had come to America before the war, and my grandmother and my aunt who came to the United States after the war. Hitler’s horror was never far from my mind, particularly when my aunt would suddenly burst out with vivid memories of hatred, violence, and death. I felt that the war in Vietnam seemed yet another juncture where genocide was on the agenda and Americans had an obligation to resist. We used to say that we refused to be “Good Germans,” that we would not be obedient citizens and acquiesce to being ruled by mass murderers. It was imperative that we stop the war; I felt compelled by all of my relatives who had been turned to ash to derail the war machine. 
        </p>
        <p>
        I sat in Kirk’s office to take my stand—risk my future, risk arrest and getting expelled, risk even my life—because my country had to stop its slaughter and its racial hatred. I had what I came to call the “already dead” experience, something I learned from reading about the fighters in concentration camps who fought to expose the Nazi crimes: They considered themselves already doomed, and that freed them to dare to resist. I was not doomed the same way the rebels in Treblinka were, of course, but I had given up any thought of a typical career or respectable middle-class life. We were, as some faculty shouted up to us, “throwing away our lives.” I was “already dead,” so to speak, and you can’t kill the dead. That meant I was free.
        </p>
        <p>
        We set up living arrangements in the few rooms of the presidential suite. We tried to maintain the office in its existing condition, although there were instances of deliberate violations and small excesses. It was difficult to keep the presidential suite clean, including its toilet, with so many people living there for nearly a week. But we tried. None of us wanted to sleep in a pile of garbage, and we weren’t there to destroy property: That would belittle what we wanted to accomplish. When we finally decided to barricade the office, we took desks and chairs and bookcases and piled them in front of the doors. 
        </p>
        <p>
        A squad of students methodically went through President Kirk’s files to send out to be published in the underground press. They exposed Columbia’s continued ties to the Institute for Defense Analyses and the Pentagon’s war in Vietnam, which Kirk had said had been cut, and the plans to steamroll the gym despite the opposition of the Harlem community and city officials. There were also schemes to transform Morningside Heights—explicit plans to buy buildings and drive out the tenants of the single-room occupancy hotels, remove minorities, and evict the elderly to create an upper-class, white enclave. After the bust, during the strike and other protests in May, there would be an occupation of a Columbia-owned building whose tenants faced eviction. 
        </p>
        <p>
        I had been living in my grandmother’s apartment on 110th Street off Broadway since she passed away during my first year at Columbia. I realized she had been a target of Columbia’s campaign to drive out people like her, the old folks on fixed incomes who would sit on the benches in the middle of Broadway to soak up the sun. It could be considered an ethical dilemma, whether or not to fish through those files in order to expose the University’s lies. Although I wasn’t directly involved, I could tell that there was no hesitation. At a time of moral collapse, of horrible war against an entire people, of vicious racial attacks like the murder of Martin Luther King Jr., one had to decide which ethical or moral lapse to accept: genocide and white supremacy, or the violation of the sanctity of business files. To me, the decision was obvious, and I never regretted that the files were, as we called it, “liberated.” 
        </p>
        <p>
        When the bust finally came, we decided to gear ourselves up for nonviolent passive resistance, standing in concentric circles and singing civil rights songs. The police would have to unlock our arms and drag us away. One of us, a navy vet, wanted to fight the cops, but the commune decided that we were not going to take that stand. He then asked if he could be locked in one of the rooms to fight the cops by himself. We decided we wouldn’t allow that either. He then chose to go out the window and, as he said, go to Hamilton Hall where he was certain the black students were going to battle the police. (There were rumors that those in Hamilton had guns.) Black students in Hamilton had negotiated an orderly arrest, with lawyers present and no media. The University, city officials, and Hamilton students had a shared interest in not wanting to provoke violence from Harlem, and SAS and other students took a wise course. 
        </p>
        <p>
        No such orderly arrests for everyone else; we faced the pent-up, furious police. As a former deputy mayor explained in 2008, the cops were fed up, having sat in buses “chewing on their nightsticks” for a week. After the cops broke through our barricades, they surrounded us. One officer stood behind a Barnard student on the outer edge of our concentric circles and lifted one of those extra-long utility flashlights high up over his head. Then, he brought it down, pounding her head. Not once, but again and again, even after she fell to the ground. That was the signal, and all hell broke loose. By chance, I was in the center of the circles with others from our literary scene and I was able to witness one communard after another being torn from the group and beaten and bloodied. I hoped that by the time they reached the center they would have tired out, but no such luck. I went through a gauntlet of cops, each beating me and tossing me to the next to do the same, until I was pushed out into the rotunda to be handcuffed.
        </p>
        <p>
        After the bust, the New York Times denounced us as barbarians but did not consider that the police acted in a savage manner, beating everyone indiscriminately inside and outside the buildings. The Times printed photos of paint splashed on the walls of Kirk’s office; all the furniture splintered, wrecked, papers scattered. “How could civilized human beings act this way?” A. M. Rosenthal <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2008/04/handcuffs-1968/">asked in his Times column</a>. The answer was, simply, we hadn’t. The cops wanted to smear us and had mauled the premises as hard as they had pounded our skulls. Rosenthal just joined in with his own wrecking ball pen.
        </p>
        <p>
        It was a shock to discover the wholesale lies that were passed off as journalism; I was there, I knew the truth. Of course, we were aware that the publisher of the Times sat on the board of trustees, warping whatever honest coverage its main reporter endeavored to do. (He apologized for the newspaper in 2008.) Yet, it felt like one more Gulf of Tonkin frame-up, another attempt to justify aggression. I felt deeply hurt, beyond just the bruises from the beating. Even my beloved New York Times was corrupt. I could no longer respect hypocrites who seemingly heralded ethics, democracy, property rights, and other such Great Ideas. That shock, along with the police violence, remained with me. It was a revelatory moment in my life, a turning point. I had been naïve, too respectful of authority, even though I already thought of myself as a literary rebel. The “Establishment,” as we named the ruling elite at the time, was hollowed out, rotten to the core, and I would do everything I could to bring the System down. 
        </p>
        <p>
        My activism was not a tantrum in rebellion against my parents, as the Daily News and others would taunt. I was anxious about how they would regard my “already dead” stance in the shadow of the Nazis and the death of my older brother just a few years before. They never objected to my position against racism and the war; they just feared that I would harm myself. I was acutely aware that I was the hope of a massacred family, and I was alarmed that I would betray their hope by getting maimed, or possibly even killed.
        </p>
        <p>
        I come from a comfortable middle-class background, but I was definitely not part of the elite. Nevertheless, in the eyes of much of the media, we were just thoughtless college kids, spoiled vandals intent on wrecking the University. The cops were angry that they couldn’t afford to send their own kids to an Ivy League school, and here we were, ungrateful brats. Today, there are parallels to all of the hateful slanders we faced with the ugly attacks launched by pro-NRA trolls against high school students who boldly speak out about gun reforms.
        </p>
        <p>
        The pro-gun reform high school students today are powered by a basic sense of survival: We want to live. In 1968, we were motivated by a similar, raw sensibility: We wanted to live. Our friends were dying in Vietnam, and many of the men upon graduation faced the draft and could end up in a vicious war to dominate a country far from us. And we wanted the Vietnamese people to live. President Lyndon B. Johnson could have been a liberal, but we still asked him, “Hey, hey, LBJ! How many kids did you kill today?” And we could see the violent oppression of black people, the fury of the urban rebellions, and we acted in the shadow of Martin Luther King’s murder.
        </p>
        <p>
        Despite our naïveté and other shortcomings, something unexpected and wonderful took place during those protests. Those of us who camped out in the president’s office came to regard ourselves as the Low Library Commune: We became disciplined, determined, and cohesive, and drew together as one body. We argued over every tactic and every negotiating point. Nothing was decided until we all spoke and reached some sort of reasoned consensus. It was an exercise in “participatory democracy,” the radical idea that those who act have to decide, and those who decide have to act. Meeting constantly, sharing burdens, keeping watch, ready to prevent any of the pro-war students from leaping through our windows, wondering what the bust would be like and when it would come, we developed a deep respect for each other. The intense competitive attitudes that filled classrooms dissolved; differences between undergraduate and graduate students, between students and people from the community, between one political faction and another, between Barnard and Columbia students, seemed to vanish. It was an exhilarating feeling, a utopian moment. We felt an urgent sense of agency that went far beyond our individual selves. The experience of having taken a stand and risked all propelled me throughout my life whenever I made a political commitment, no matter how contentious—for instance, when I would criticize Zionism and work to support the Palestinian people.
        </p>
        <p>
        We were not going to accept the world as given, and we bound together in learning the truth of our social conditions and, more importantly, learning that we had to act. The Liberation School that flowered after the bust, for example, opened new ways of thinking. I was already reading far beyond the Core texts. I loved Sophocles and Kant, but we had to discover on our own W. E. B. Du Bois, Emma Goldman, Frederick Douglass, Herbert Marcuse, and so many others not on our reading lists. In the immediate aftermath of the occupation and strike, we began to search for the true history of America’s wars, the resistance of indigenous people, the labor movement, the abolitionists, and more. We broke the the writings of Simone de Beauvoir, Betty Friedan, Anaïs Nin, Gloria Steinem, Angela Davis, and others would join our reading lists. In a year, the gay liberation movement would erupt at Stonewall.
        </p>
        <p>
        Many of us entered into full-time political organizing, such as working with anti-war GIs or shaping our lives to be “relevant.” It was a heady time, and we made mistakes—but we had realized that we could actually change the world, that people could take action together and make a difference. And we did change the world, although not as much as we had hoped. For one thing, Gym Crow was never built. That was a victory to relish.
        </p>
        <p>
        Thank you, Low Library Commune. I feel fortunate to have gotten much of my Columbia education in President Kirk’s office.
        </p>

        The stream of violent images from 1968 begins on the first day of February, with a Viet Cong prisoner grimacing just before a South Vietnamese police chief puts his pistol against the man’s head and fires. We see the prisoner jerked out of the frame, his head contorting from the bullet's impact, blood spurting from his temple. The footage plays repeatedly on the evening news, heightening the tension caused by the Tet Offensive that had been launched two days earlier and had caught American forces by surprise.
        </p>
        <p>
        The scene in this photograph happened the day I joined Da Da, the Columbia rock band that would play in support of the student strike in April. Our name was meant to convey the spirit of the art movement and the images of cultural violence. We looked the part: two long-haired hippies and two black guys—myself and a singer who looked like Jimi Hendrix. The white guys and I were students at the college, and the other black guy lived downtown in Greenwich Village.
        </p>
        <p>        
        Da Da had two weeks to rehearse with me, their new drummer, for a concert on February 16th at the McMillin Theater (now the Miller Theatre). As the opening act for the Byrds, the progressive group whose early work had been associated with Bob Dylan, we wanted to make a political statement. 
        </p>
        <p>            
        The strike and occupation that eventually shut down Columbia would begin several months later, on April 23rd. Students for a Democratic Society had been protesting Columbia's policies, as well as its involvement in military research. At that point, there had been no significant confrontation with police, but the tension was palpable. To use Dylan's words, there was revolution in the air.
        </p>
        <p>
        I had many friends in SDS, including Mark Rudd, who would lead the strike and occupation of buildings in April, and Ted Gold, who would die several years later in a Village townhouse while he was assembling a bomb. I had known Ted back at Stuyvesant High School, where I had been part of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. At Columbia, I continued to identify with the radical contingent. That affiliation, along with my preference for white music and my circle of white friends, separated me from the other black students. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Da Da wrote a dozen songs over the next two weeks. The staff at Ferris Booth Hall, now Lerner Hall, let us rehearse every afternoon in Wollman Auditorium. Our songs were a cross between The Who and Pink Floyd––clever, kinetic, and lyrically obscure. We were young and disaffected, but free of the trauma that had been experienced by some of the black students, particularly those who had come from the segregated South. I had grown up in Brooklyn, shielded from outright prejudice, though not totally assimilated into the Jewish culture of the public schools I attended. 
        </p>
        <p>
        The Byrds had just fired David Crosby, the talented singer and guitarist who would go on to form the group Crosby, Stills & Nash at the end of 1968. On February 16th, the night of the concert, they showed up with Gram Parsons in place of Crosby. The McMillin Theater held 700 people, and there were no empty seats. We saw the complete gamut of Columbia life—musicians from other campus bands, our liberal friends, conservatives, athletes and even some faculty members. For the last time before the strike, these disparate groups assembled peacefully. Hardly any black students attended. 
        </p>
        <p>
        We played our dozen songs to the encouragement of our audience. Afterward, we watched the Byrds from offstage, then went to our guitarist's apartment and listened to a tape of our performance. The next day, the New York Times ran <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1968/02/18/89321907.html?action=click&contentCollection=Archives&module=ArticleEndCTA&region=ArchiveBody&pgtype=article&pageNumber=80">a review</a>  of the concert and gave us favorable mention.
        </p>
        <p>
        Da Da went on to play at a few of the clubs downtown, including The Scene, where well-known musicians played jam sessions, and The Generation, which Jimi Hendrix later bought and converted into Electric Lady Studios. Jimi also ran the occasional jam at Generation. 
        </p>
        <p>
        One night, a musician friend took me to meet Jimi, and I wound up sitting in on drums. Hardly any Columbia students saw this. A few of the white students heard about it and were suitably impressed. None of the black students knew and might not have cared if they had. Jimi's audience was mainly white. 
        </p>
        <p>
        In the spring of 1968, I was invisible to the black community on campus. By then, they had written off my appearance—shaggy afro, dark glasses, fringe jacket, and bell-bottom jeans—as evidence that I didn't know or care about projecting a respectable image. They had started a chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha, the international black fraternity, and had organized the Student Afro-American Society, which would become the active force in taking over Hamilton Hall. But I was not part of the group, and they had no idea of my previous political activities.
        </p>
        <p>
        Along with a few of my SDS friends, I had been part of a sit-in several months earlier by the Resistance, an anti-war movement that blocked the entrance to the draft induction center on Whitehall Street. We were forced out of our sitting position by a squad of mounted police. Other cops herded us into paddy wagons that took us to a nearby holding facility, where we remained for several hours. That was in December 1967. By the spring of 1968, SDS made little reference to the Resistance, possibly because those who would later form the Weathermen faction did not want to share public attention. I was invisible to them as well.
        </p>
        <p>
        On the morning of April 23rd, my roommate woke me to say that something was going on at Hamilton Hall. I got dressed and went up to campus, where I saw a crowd in front of the building. Students should have been streaming in and out of the doors, on their way to and from class, but they were just standing around. 
        </p>
        <p>
        I walked up the steps, and the crowd parted to let me through. On the other side of the front door, several black students stared back at me. After a few minutes, they opened the door, and I went inside. In the lobby, I spoke with those who knew me and nodded at the rest. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Upstairs on the second floor, I joined a small group out on the balcony, where we stared down at the crowd below. A man wearing shades and a windbreaker aimed a camera at us, and our group later appeared on the cover of Time magazine. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Coming in from the balcony, I learned that SAS had taken over the building and kicked SDS out after a disagreement over tactics. Mark Rudd led the SDS contingent to take over other buildings. The discord confused me, because I identified more with SDS than SAS. I was in no position to say this, and since I was not a member of SAS, I had no real voice in its proceedings.
        </p>
        <p>
        In Low Library, members of SDS occupied the office of University President Grayson Kirk. An iconic photograph of poet David Shapiro, a college senior, sitting at Kirk's desk and smoking a cigar became a symbol of the uprising. The so-called Majority Coalition, a group of students opposed to the occupation, surrounded Low and formed a blockade to prevent supplies from reaching those inside. SDS also took over Mathematics, Avery, and Fayerweather Halls. 
        </p>
        <p>
        The day wore on. I managed to get a peanut butter sandwich for lunch, but I ran out of cigarettes. Late in the day, I heard that someone outside was asking for me. I went to the front door and saw my guitarist, who reminded me that we had a gig to play that evening. Feeling a mixture of reluctance and relief, I left Hamilton and did not return.
        </p>
        <p>
        A week later, Columbia allowed the police to clear the occupied buildings. Thanks to the preparation and presence of legal counsel, the black students experienced no violence. They were peacefully arrested and brought out of Hamilton in orderly fashion. My SDS friends and their supporters were not so fortunate. They were beaten and dragged out of the other buildings. Had I returned after my gig to join SDS, I might have been severely injured. A black General Studies student who had been outside during the police attack suffered a serious head wound. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Several days later, Da Da played a set on the patio in front of Ferris Booth Hall. A large crowd of strike supporters and a few conservatives attended. The atmosphere was different from the Byrds concert—our music was a distraction from the violence. Again, I saw few black students in the audience.
        </p>
