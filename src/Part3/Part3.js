                <p >Alternating weekdays, in the afternoon, I commute via the 1 train to work at the Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center. This means that three days a week, through windows filmed over by oil and dust, I see Columbia’s new Manhattanville campus. It’s eye-catching—the mammoth size and glass composition distinguish the newly-erected facilities from brick and concrete surroundings—and appears spacious. </p>                

                <p>The train tracks are elevated well above Broadway at 129th Street, so eye level for me isn’t street-level. My gaze falls upon what I assume is research and office space, but I can’t see inside completely (the sun’s glare casts a blue glaze over the glass facade). I wonder if anyone inside the center is looking out at the passing trains. </p>

                <p>This glistening campus has come up frequently in the discussions that surround the 50-year anniversary of the 1968 protests due to the parallels between it and “Gym Crow”—the moniker ascribed to Columbia’s plans to construct a gym in Morningside Park that partially instigated the protests. </p>   

                <p>The parallels were addressed by President Lee Bollinger himself at the 40th anniversary of the protests in 2008, five years after the announcement of the Manhattanville expansion. At the time, he insisted that the University had changed since ‘68 and was more receptive to community concerns. But both then and now, residents have viewed both projects as a zero-sum game where Columbia expands at the expense of the community.</p>

                <p>This year’s 50th anniversary is the first 1968 decennial for which parts of the Manhattanville campus have actually been built, and conversation around the two expansion projects has become increasingly polarized. Some cite the 1968 protests as an inflection point for Columbia, after which it <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/opinion/2018/04/23/discourse-debate-what-do-we-owe-west-harlem/">attempted to be more conscientious of its presence and impact in Harlem</a>. Many students and residents, though, feel that the standing campus is a symbol both of a failure to replicate the level of protestor engagement demonstrated in 1968 and of Columbia’s continued infringement on the neighborhood.</p>

                <p>Indeed, much of the conversation intertwining these two expansion projects has condensed into a few narratives: On Columbia’s part, Manhattanville was a success for being built, and the aborted 1968 gym was a failure; on the community’s part, preventing the construction of the gym was only a short-lived success that has not had long-lasting impacts on Columbia’s behavior, and the construction of Manhattanville is a stamp of failure. But how do we fully compare the two periods of activism? Is it physical completion of a project that hallmarks its success?</p>

                <br>
                </br>

                <p><b>Activism mounts against both expansion projects</b></p>
                <p>On December 29, 1958, the Committee on Columbia College Gymnasium released its first report urging the erection of a new athletics facility in publicly-owned Morningside Park for Columbia undergraduates. In the summer of 2003, Bollinger announced Columbia’s plans to build a <a href="http://manhattanville.columbia.edu/news/columbia-university-dedicates-its-17-acre-manhattanville-campus-establishing-its-academic-and">$6.3 billion, 17-acre campus</a> in Manhattanville.</p>

                <p>By the mid-1960s, local organizations, including the West Harlem Community Organization, Morningsiders United, the Harlem Mau Maus, and the Architects Renewal Council of Harlem, and local politicians, including New York State Senator Basil Paterson, began to mobilize. On April 23, 1968, Columbia Student Afro-American Society and Students for a Democratic Society (a predominantly white organization) joined forces with community activists, including <a href="https://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/catalog/69erx5xt9780252034527.html">Stokely Carmichael (also known as Kwame Ture) and H. Rap Brown</a>, during the Hamilton Hall occupation.</p>

                <a href="#" data-featherlight="https://arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-spectator.s3.amazonaws.com/public/56XN475BYJE23FGX5FMBOBT7FQ.jpg"><img style={{float:"center", "width": "120%", "marginBottom": "10px", "marginLeft": "-10%","marginRight": "0", "paddingLeft": "0", "paddingRight": "0"}} src="https://arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-spectator.s3.amazonaws.com/public/56XN475BYJE23FGX5FMBOBT7FQ.jpg"/></a>

                <p>Much like during the late ‘60s, community and student activists assembled in opposition to the Manhattanville proposal, concerned with heightening rent prices and business displacement. Two particularly prolific groups—the Coalition to Preserve Community and the Student Coalition on Expansion and Gentrification—<a href="http://www.reconnectingamerica.org/assets/Uploads/20130425ciso12011.pdf">operated in tandem to organize meetings, rallies, and campouts against the Manhattanville expansion</a>, beginning in 2003.</p> 

                <p>Partitioned by fifty orbits around the sun, both waves of anti-Columbia expansion activism brought together people of different ages, races, and socio-economic classes through a shared sense of urgency.</p>

                <p>In May 1966, community advocates, city politicians, and Columbia administrators—including City Councilman J. Raymond Jones, Mayor John Lindsay and Columbia President Grayson Kirk—met to discuss the community-allocated portion of the gym. When Jones presented the community’s proposal that the University, in compensation for taking over nearly two acres of public green space, should allow the community to use at least 50 percent of the gymnasium complex, a spokesman for the mayor said Lindsay felt “there was no hope of an agreement.”</p> 

                <p>In an effort to appease these requests, Columbia offered to construct a community pool in July of 1967 which would cost $465,000 and increase the public portion of the gym from 12 percent to 16 percent. This attempt backfired, only further fueling community resentment. State Assemblyman Charles Rangel declared at the first West Harlem rally against the proposed gym on July 29 that it was an insult to the people in the Harlem community for Columbia to offer a segregated pool as compensation for its plan to <a href="http://spectatorarchive.library.columbia.edu/cgi-bin/columbia?a=d&d=cs19670803-02.2.7&e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-------">“take away grass and trees.”</a> There was a clear rift in communication; even in its few attempts at community reparation, the administration was willfully ignorant of what the neighborhood residents needed.</p>

                <p>In October 2004, Community Board 9 (the advisory group for Morningside Heights, Manhattanville, Hamilton Heights, and the Sugar Hill Historic District) voted on whether to approve the <a href="http://prattcenter.net/sites/default/files/cb9m_final_24-sep-07.pdf">197-a Plan</a>, which they had designed alongside urban planners from the Pratt Center. The document outlined job, housing, and school infrastructure intended to mitigate the problem of tenant displacement due to the Manhattanville campus, and recommended negotiations of a Community Benefits Agreement, a memorandum of financial commitment to the neighborhood in light of the expansion. Both the official vote of the 32 CB9 members and the unofficial vote of the 26 other neighborhood residents present at the meeting were unanimously in favor of the plan, which was approved by the <a href="http://www.reconnectingamerica.org/assets/Uploads/20130425ciso12011.pdf">Department of City Planning in 2005</a>.</p> 

                <p>In spring 2005, the Student Coalition on Expansion and Gentrification <a href="https://coalitionagainstgentrification.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/facultyletterpdf.pdf">released an open letter</a>, cosigned by 54 Columbia professors, demanding that President Bollinger and the Board of Trustees accept the limitations of Plan 197-a in the construction of the Manhattanville campus. Two years later, Columbia announced a 197-c rezoning plan, which among other differences relied on the use of eminent domain and eliminated what CB9 referred to as <a href="http://features.columbiaspectator.com/eye/2016/10/12/how-to-preserve-a-neighborhood/">"the neighborhood's dynamic richly layered historic, ethnic, and cultural character"</a> through a lack of historic preservation.</p>  

                <p>On August 15, 2007, CB9 held a five-hour public hearing on Columbia’s 197-c application, during which the gathered crowd <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0JpF07SOo4">booed at President Bollinger</a> for refusing to engage with 197-a. In spite of community dissent—<a href="https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/08/16/panel-rejects-columbias-expansion-plan/">22 people testified in favor of the plan and 73 against</a>—the Department of City Planning and New York City Council approved Columbia’s 197-c proposal in late 2007.</p>

                <p>Nevertheless, student and community activism continued throughout this time. 
                On March 22, 2012, as members of the CPC and St. Mary’s Congregations for Justice and Peace <a href="https://stopcolumbia.wordpress.com/page/3/">joined forces with Columbia students to march against Columbia University’s expansion plans</a>, their efforts culminated in an occupation of the Tuck-it-Away storage building lobby (which would eventually be acquired by Columbia via eminent domain). <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0b7FnkNNcI">"Not for sale!" protesters chanted</a>, banging drums to the beat.</p>

                <a href="#" data-featherlight="https://arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-spectator.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YJVHIYE3BFHPBB62XGQ7FKLWO4.jpg"><img style={{float:"center", "width": "120%", "marginBottom": "10px", "marginLeft": "-10%","marginRight": "0", "paddingLeft": "0", "paddingRight": "0"}} src="https://arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-spectator.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YJVHIYE3BFHPBB62XGQ7FKLWO4.jpg"/></a>

                <p>Walking down Broadway, they’re a crowd of neon flyers and posters. The group pauses in front of Columbia University Employment Information Center. One protester, downed in a light pink button up and thin wire frame glasses, strums the guitar, singing improvisationally and with emphatic conviction: “We will not be moved, we will not be moved, we will not be moved today.”</p>

                <p>The 1968 riots lasted for eight days. Manhattanville protests endured for over ten years.</p>

                <br>
                </br>

                <p><b>
                Architecture and rhetoric diverges for Manhattanville
                </b></p>
                <p>While the activism opposing the Manhattanville expansion is reminiscent of that opposing the Morningside Gym, the construction plans for the two projects are markedly different.</p>

                <p>On the <a href="https://exhibitions.library.columbia.edu/exhibits/show/1968/causes/gym">cross-sectional blueprint</a> of the proposed Morningside gym, the two entrances, one in the upper-left corner of the page at “Morningside Drive level”—for students—and one about 80 feet below in the lower-right edge, at “Morningside Park level”—for community residents—are dwarfed by the space in between them. Practically the farthest two points on the blueprint, they feel so geographically isolated it’s hard to imagine them belonging to the same building.</p>

                <p>I imagine myself walking into the gym as a student. I enter on Morningside Drive near 113th Street, walk past the swimming pool and the diving pool and into the main gymnasium. I go down a flight of stairs: the intramural gymnasium. Another flight: Squash courts await. I descend even further, and finally arrive at the lowest level: the community gymnasium. There sits the Morningside Park entrance.</p>

                <p>Columbia’s vision of a separate, physically lower entrance and facilities for community members carried connotations antithetical to that of the Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of Education, in which the Court, just four years earlier, had ruled that “separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.” That, combined with stark racial discrepancies (around <a href="http://www.columbia-current.org/breaking-through-a-bastion-of-whiteness.html">2%</a> of Columbia College’s student body was black compared to <a href="http://www.gothamgazette.com/index.php/city/4077-harlems-shifting-population">95%</a> of Harlem’s population at the time) and the nationwide spread of the civil rights and Black Power movement, meant the image of Columbia encroaching on Harlem parkland became fraught with controversy.</p> 

                <p>Meanwhile, Columbia’s Manhattanville campus, a colossal cluster of glass-enclosed research and academic buildings, marks a shift in architectural diligence from that of the proposed Morningside gym.</p> 

                <p>This February, I ventured into the Jerome L. Greene Science Center with my Frontiers of Science class to tour a lab that studies learning, memory, and decision-making in humans. The actual organization of the buildings presents no disruption to the surroundings. There are no gates, no stairs; the Manhattanville campus isn’t elevated like the Morningside campus. I simply walk up the sidewalk, and I’m here. The center’s glass door is heavy, so I plant my feet and lean back, pulling the handle toward me.</p>

                <p>A New York Times headline from March 24, 1968, <i>How Not to Build a Symbol</i>, references the virtually windowless walls and “brutal” 126-foot high rear facade of the gym in a lamentation criticizing the gymnasium as a disastrous emblem of a deep and bitter fissure—one that severs Columbia from the surrounding community. The structure’s rigid physical and emotional isolationism, argues the piece, is “grossly imperceptive.”</p>

                <p>Meanwhile, as Marcelo Velez, the Vice President of Manhattanville Development at Columbia, told <a href="https://archpaper.com/2016/10/renzo-piano-jerome-l-greene-science-center/#gallery-0-slide-0">the Architect’s Newspaper</a>, the transparency of the Manhattanville campus functions both to reassure the public that “nothing sinister is going on within the scientific research building” as well as to “act as a form of community engagement.”</p>

                <p>The transparent buildings in the Manhattanville campus also house communal facilities and events—indication of their explicit efforts to make the grounds an integrated community space. <a href="http://features.columbiaspectator.com/eye/2017/10/24/new-gallery-on-the-block/">Wallach Art Gallery</a>, one space which is open to the public, has featured local artists featuring Black and Latinx culture. At the Mortimer B. Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute’s <a href="https://zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/education-lab">Education Lab</a>, Columbia neuroscientists lead monthly <a href="https://zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/saturday-science">Saturday Science</a> events on brain-related topics, which are free and open to the public. As of February this year, <a href="http://manhattanville.columbia.edu/news/now-open-community-wellness-center">The Community Wellness Center</a>, located at 610 W. 130th Street in the Jerome L. Greene Science Center, houses two mental health and stroke prevention education programs and provides free blood pressure readings, cholesterol screening, and AIC glucose testing to the public.</p> 

                <p>These spaces, molded and delegated and talked about with emphasis on institution/community homogeneity, mark a shift from the physical detachment of Columbia’s proposed gym. On the <a href="http://manhattanville.columbia.edu/">homepage for the Manhattanville Campus</a>, Columbia invites viewers to explore its various community benefits, mentioning <a href="http://manhattanville.columbia.edu/">"community education centers"</a> and <a href="http://manhattanville.columbia.edu/">a "diverse construction workforce providing local jobs and opportunity."</a> In October 24, 2016, at a dedication to the new campus, President Lee Bollinger describes the project as an <a href="http://manhattanville.columbia.edu/news/columbia-university-dedicates-its-17-acre-manhattanville-campus-establishing-its-academic-and">“opportunity to build exceptional spaces...in a way that benefits our city and community.”</a></p>

                <br>
                </br>

                <p><b>
                Remembering the past, and present
                </b></p>
                <p>I often take early strolls through Morningside Park as the sun rouses the starry sky and my drowsy body awakens with it; there’s something deeply cathartic about the brief respite from campus, being in a patch of green and blue among concrete workplaces and brick residences. Perhaps the serenity comes from the physical distance: The topography of Morningside Heights elevates campus from the park and most of Harlem. It’s nearly impossible to fathom how plopping a concrete edifice big enough for two swimming pools in the park wouldn’t strip away the essence of the space.</p> 

                <p>Fifty years ago, victory for the activists came in the form of <a href="http://archives.nypl.org/scm/20875">Columbia’s concession to cancel the Morningside gym project.</a> In addition to the new campus including public facilities and hosting public events—a clear departure from the University’s concept of separate gymnasiums—Columbia signed a <a href="https://gca.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/2016-11/CBAAgreement.pdf">Community Benefits Agreement</a> in 2009. Although the CBA was not approved by CB9 and has instigated disputes over the actual allocation of funds as well as the <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/the-eye/2018/02/14/as-a-neighborhood-school-flourishes-from-columbia-partnership-funding-cutoff-looms/">durability of the services</a>, by signing the document, Columbia did commit to providing $150 million in money and services to West Harlem.</p>

                <p>When asked about regrets about his years spent as a chief organizer of the Manhattanville protests—maybe lost time or wasted efforts—Kappner remains positive: “I marvel at how successful we actually were.” For him, all the meetings and demonstrations and riots weren’t a failure just because buildings were built.</p>

                <p>Comparisons of the two projects that reduce the discussion to physical completion undermine years of activism carried out by the community and negate differences in both the physical expansion plans and changes in approach on Columbia’s part. To take on these simplistic notions of failure and success is inaccurate and irresponsible. As Frank A. Guridy, an associate professor of history and African-American studies at Columbia, wrote earlier this month, <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/opinion/2018/04/26/why-we-need-to-remember-1968-now/">“The [1968] protests should no longer linger in the background of the University’s public history—instead, we ought to recognize their importance, and our students should lead the way in helping us reimagine our relationship with Columbia’s remarkable past.”</a> Perhaps the same should be done for Manhattanville.</p>
